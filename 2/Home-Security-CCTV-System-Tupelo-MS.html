All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present suggestion.</p>
