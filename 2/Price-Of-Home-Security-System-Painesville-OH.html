<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
