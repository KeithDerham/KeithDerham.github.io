<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
