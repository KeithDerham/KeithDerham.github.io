<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
