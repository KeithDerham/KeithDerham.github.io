<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's delegated the company's polite, knowledgeable experts.

After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
