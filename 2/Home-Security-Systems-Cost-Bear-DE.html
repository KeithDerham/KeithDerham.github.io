<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw great lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.
