<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
