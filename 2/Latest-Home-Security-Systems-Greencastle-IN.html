At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm ought to suffice to scare away intruders most of the times. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and supply physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to call for police action.</p>
