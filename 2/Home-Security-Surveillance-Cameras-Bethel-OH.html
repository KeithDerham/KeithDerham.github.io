Expect to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the clever brands expand their ranges. If you receive a billing for excessive false alarms, you may appeal it. First, we suggest that you phone the Napa Cops Department Records Department to discuss your questions and concerns. If you are dissatisfied with the results of this discussion, you might request a formal appeal hearing.</p>
