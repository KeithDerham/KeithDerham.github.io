<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to spot it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
