<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great option for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
