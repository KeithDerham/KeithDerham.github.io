<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
