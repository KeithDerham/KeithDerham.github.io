<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
