Their timeframe for response in under 10 seconds, which we must admit is rather exceptional. A note of importance, if you wish to get the SimpliSafe app, then you would need to register for the more costly monitoring plan.</p>
<p>A bigger security company that constantly monitors your home will have a designated station that sees thousands of homes and businesses simultaneously. They cost more because they have to go through confirmation with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit company that concentrates on screening services and products to guarantee maximum reliability and safety. </p>
