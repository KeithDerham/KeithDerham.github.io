<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is necessary. There are only 2 options if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup information to make this integration work. The first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to provide those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>

Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
