Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not.

<p>IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an ingrained video server having an IP address, capable of streaming the video (and in some cases, even audio).

<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
