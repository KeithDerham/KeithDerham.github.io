<h3>The Best Security System For Your Home in Punta Gorda FL</h3>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

All these factors to consider will affect what system you ultimately pick. For example, if you require to record high-definition surveillance video over long periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>
