With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
