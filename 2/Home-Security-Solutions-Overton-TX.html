<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.

Increasing release of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous websites needing alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer support experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
