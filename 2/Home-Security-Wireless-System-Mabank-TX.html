<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

In many cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to precisely examine crime patterns for camera positioning; however, the placement of cameras can also be the outcome of input from police officers and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
