The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the destructive opponent to tape-record these codes and utilize various splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "design" security essential caught throughout the network healing.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
