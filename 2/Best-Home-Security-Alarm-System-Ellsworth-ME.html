A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're transforming the clever home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Given that they're so clearly recognizable as a security camera, they're a terrific deterrent too, and they're simple to mount almost anywhere. With the common weatherproof hoods, they're quite durable, but they don't always included the full IP certification of other models.</p>

Much like Vizzini's overuse of unthinkable" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to throw around the word wireless" quite easily. We get it.

<p>Another important subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough.

The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>

For instance, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is spotted, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin taping when a sensing unit is triggered. Some systems store taped video in your area on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others use cloud storage. Locally saved video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, however you need to be careful not to overwrite video you might require later.
