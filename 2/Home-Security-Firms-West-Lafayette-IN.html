<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
