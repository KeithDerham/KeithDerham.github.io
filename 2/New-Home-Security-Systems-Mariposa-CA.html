We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

It is likewise geared up with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to focus and record information such as facial functions in case of break-ins.</p>
