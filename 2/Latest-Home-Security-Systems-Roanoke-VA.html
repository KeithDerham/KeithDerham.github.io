<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assailant, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and in fact indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to record these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential recorded during the network healing.</p>
