On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensing unit in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
