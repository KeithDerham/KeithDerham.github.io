It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a learning period).

Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and short of a general power interruption, are more difficult to disrupt. Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and paralyzed. </p>
