<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
