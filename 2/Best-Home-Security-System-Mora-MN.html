We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
