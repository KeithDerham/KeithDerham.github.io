If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
