<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the exact very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.

If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
