<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
