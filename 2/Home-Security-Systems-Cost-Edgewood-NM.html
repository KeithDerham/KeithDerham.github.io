<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
