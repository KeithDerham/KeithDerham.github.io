<h2>Reasons Why CCTV Security Systems Are Vital For Your Business Hagerstown</h2>

The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>Piza and associates (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the effects of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on crime prevention. The researchers searched for CCTV examinations published in between 2007 and 2017 to represent the duration since the last review (which covered examinations completed in 2006 and earlier). Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about upcoming examinations.
