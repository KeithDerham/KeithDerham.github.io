<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies?

<p>Among the obstacles wise alarm systems position to the consumer is the risk of being hacked.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
