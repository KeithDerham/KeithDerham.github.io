<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm.
