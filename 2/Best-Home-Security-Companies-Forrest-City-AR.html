A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based on info about the temperature differences. Because items are rarely specifically the exact same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
