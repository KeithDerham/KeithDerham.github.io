<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
