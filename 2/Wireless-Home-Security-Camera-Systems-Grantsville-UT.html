<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole community. The equipment needed for the wired system tends to be a bit less expensive than the wireless systems.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
