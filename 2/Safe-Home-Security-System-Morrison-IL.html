<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more economical memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, but we think it's worth the investment.

Many sites needing alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
