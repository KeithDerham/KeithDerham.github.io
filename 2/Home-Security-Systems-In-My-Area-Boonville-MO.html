<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for capturing a thief in the act, though. They're also helpful for casual home monitoring. Put on counter tops, tables, and shelves, they allow you to keep an eye on what your pets are doing, know when the kids get home from school, or find who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. Most even enable you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, via an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise might frighten prospective trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the cops won't come until you personally call them. </p>
