<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; whatever within their focus ability is recorded. That is to say, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it concerns separating the images of an active occurrence about to take place. However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
