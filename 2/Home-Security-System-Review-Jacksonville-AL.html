<p>Another area where Arlo excels is customer support. After long-term screening this camera because we first made it a pick in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q began predicting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing issue for some owners. We called consumer support, which offered a complimentary replacement unit-- despite the fact that the service warranty had actually long given that expired.</p>
<p>Security: There have been a lot of headlines about hackers jeopardizing home cameras, child displays, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so be sure to examine what steps has each manufacturer taken to remove this issue. Search for a camera that supports current wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>
