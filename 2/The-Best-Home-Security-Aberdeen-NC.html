<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
