<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
