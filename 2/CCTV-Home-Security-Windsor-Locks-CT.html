<p>Smart device combination: If you have a home full of wise devices, consider trying to find a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can connect them.

However, after nearly 2 years of use, day and night images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight mice, cars and trucks, and moths.</p>
