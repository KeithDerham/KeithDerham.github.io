Nevertheless, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
