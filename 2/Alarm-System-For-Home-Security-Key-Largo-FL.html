<p>When motion is spotted, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to tape-record video. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is occurring, and some will likewise generate an email alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if someone is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensor.

Window sensing units don't secure versus someone smashing through large glass windows or sliding glass doors and walking through it.
