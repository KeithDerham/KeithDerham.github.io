<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems usually do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<p>If you use Alexa to manage the smart lights in your home, then you need to consider trying Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of cool tricks.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll also get a notification if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should suffice to frighten trespassers in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be certified, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and supply physical evidence like camera video or a broken window to warrant authorities action.</p>
