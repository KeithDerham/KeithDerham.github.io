Lorex is happy to supply consumers with a wide range of security cameras for all environments. Search our HD, 4K Ultra HD, WiFi, and PTZ security cameras options to find the best fit.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a little more if you wish to include additional features, like a security camera. While a normal contract runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to rent their equipment.
