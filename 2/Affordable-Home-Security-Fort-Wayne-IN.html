<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
