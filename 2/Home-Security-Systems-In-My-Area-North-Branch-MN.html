<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level.

HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
