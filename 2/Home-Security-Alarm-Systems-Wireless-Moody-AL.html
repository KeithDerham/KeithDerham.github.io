Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is plenty of offered light, and when the lighting ends up being low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Commercial cameras outshine their less expensive cousins because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adapt and record outstanding low light video.</p>
<p>Simply a couple decades back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names using pricey, rigid plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.
