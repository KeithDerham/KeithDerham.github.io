We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
