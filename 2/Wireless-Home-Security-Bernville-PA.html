<p>Offense of the security boundary of a business network can come from a number of different techniques and intents. One of these techniques is referred to as unintentional association". When a user switches on a computer system and it latches on to a wireless gain access to point from a neighboring company's overlapping network, the user may not even know that this has happened. However, it is a security breach because exclusive company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one company to the other.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public places is good - it assists in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post criminal offense examination is simple and capturing perpetrators is simple for law-enforcement officers. </p>
