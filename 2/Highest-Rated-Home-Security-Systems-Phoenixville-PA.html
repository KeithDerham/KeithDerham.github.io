Without any drilling or complex electrical wiring to be done, wireless systems generally do not need professional installation, and considering that they do not need a labor-intensive and extensive elimination of wires, they can be moved relatively quickly, a certain benefit for renters and people on the go. It's a versatile form of security technology, due to the fact that sensors can be moved and added with relative ease. They are also extremely integratable, because wireless systems can be synched up with other home automation features, such as smart locks and lights.</p>

False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
