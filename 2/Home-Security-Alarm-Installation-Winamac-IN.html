<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
