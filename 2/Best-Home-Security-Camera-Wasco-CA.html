Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the debate over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a dispute that's frequently manipulated by elements such as skepticism over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause incorrect alarms. While improvements recently have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
