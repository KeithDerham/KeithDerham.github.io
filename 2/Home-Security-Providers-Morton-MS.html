<p>Heaven by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in progress. We've seen enhancements during our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't suggest a $200 camera that does not offer the capability to zoom video and won't be able to withstand outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Watch on your home, office, or store with our video surveillance systems.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
