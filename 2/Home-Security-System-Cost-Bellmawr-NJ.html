<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
