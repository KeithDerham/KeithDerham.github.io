<h3>Home Wireless Alarm System in Gering NE</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>
