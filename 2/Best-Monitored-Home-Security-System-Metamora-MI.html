<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
