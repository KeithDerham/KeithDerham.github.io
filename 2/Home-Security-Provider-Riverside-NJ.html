<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide.
