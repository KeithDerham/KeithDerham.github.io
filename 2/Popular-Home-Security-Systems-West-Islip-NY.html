Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
