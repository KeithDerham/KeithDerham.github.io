<p>Connect Interactive may have a great deal of equipment, however it's not constantly the most attractive stuff out there. Plus, Link Interactive's not as well-known of a brand as, state, ADT.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Screens can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely typical kind of two piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or generally closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to distance to the second piece which consists of a magnet.

This action combined with an electric existing (normally at 12V DC) permits an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very typical and are discovered either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can generally be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
