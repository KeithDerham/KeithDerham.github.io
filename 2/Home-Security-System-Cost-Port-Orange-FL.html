<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This means that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, particularly if your home is bigger than 4,500 square feet.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>This model also features a clever app that lets you see through the eyes of your cameras and quickly record at any time. On the disadvantage, when motion detection is activated, its cameras are periodically overly delicate and send out informs even if very little movement outside has been found.
