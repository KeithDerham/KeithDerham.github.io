<h3>Smart Home Security System in Georgia</h3>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of a things and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation. Care should be required to ensure the surrounding soil uses good drainage in order to prevent problem alarms.</p>

It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise referred to as the alarm panel).
