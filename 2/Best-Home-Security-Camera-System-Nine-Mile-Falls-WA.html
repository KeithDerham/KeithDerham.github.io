<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
