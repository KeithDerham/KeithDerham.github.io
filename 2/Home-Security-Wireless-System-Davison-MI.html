We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect signals). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
