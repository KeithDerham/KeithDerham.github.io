<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more costly overall per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>The Blink XT2 is the very best home security camera for those searching for a really wireless choice for less than $100.
