We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
