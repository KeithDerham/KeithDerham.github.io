<p>Home automation is hassle-free and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies provide a home automation plan with an app to remotely manage everything on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't very smart. Wireless gadgets interact more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
