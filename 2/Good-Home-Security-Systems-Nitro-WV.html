<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
