<h3>Security System Companies Vandalia IL 62471</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
