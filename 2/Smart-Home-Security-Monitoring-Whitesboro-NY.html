<p>Some of the more costly cameras are geared up with humidity and temperature sensing units and will communicate with other connected home gadgets such as thermostats and clever lighting systems. If you want to save some money, try to find a camera with an SD card slot that permits you to record video when motion or sound is spotted, however keep in mind to conserve your recordings every now and then before they are overwritten.
