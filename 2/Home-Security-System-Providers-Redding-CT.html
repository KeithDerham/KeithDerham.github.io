<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm. Many monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>
<p>Most video captures images in the natural light or infrared spectrums. Thermal cameras can likewise catch video of an individual's motions based on body temperature.

Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems use standard phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
