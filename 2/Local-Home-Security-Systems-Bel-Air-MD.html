The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically two years of day, use and night images have always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered.
