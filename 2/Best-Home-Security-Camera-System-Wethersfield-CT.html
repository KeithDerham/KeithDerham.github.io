At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm ought to suffice to frighten intruders in most cases.

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a learning period).
