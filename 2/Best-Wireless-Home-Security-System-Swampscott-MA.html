<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to offer it an attractive edge, and we have to offer credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from as much as four cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and uncomfortable to utilize on event - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times.
