<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company.

We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
