<p>We have actually rounded up our top choices for the best wireless home security system and rated each competitor to earn a spot on our list according to their specifications-focusing on ease of use and installation, remote app functions, and clever home combination.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system discovers a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security group and, sometimes, emergency situation responders. Unfortunately, history has revealed that surveillance innovations put in place for one function inevitably broaden into other uses. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems need to be able to do positions a significant threat.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm but you remain in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get alerted until the next day?
