<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is necessary. There are just two options if there are no as-built documents offering performance and configuration details to make this integration work. The very first choice, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is reluctant or not available to provide those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
