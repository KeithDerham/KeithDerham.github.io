<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
