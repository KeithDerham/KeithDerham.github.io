<h2>Choosing A Video Surveillance Camera Audubon</h2>

<h3>Security Camera Installation in Audubon NJ</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>The huge reward is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that does not look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it seldom sends out false alerts since it tracks your phone (and other family member's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns everything off. Similarly, it will arm itself immediately when everybody has actually left.</p>
