<h2>Problems With Wireless Outdoor Security Cameras Great Falls</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you need to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really irritating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too costly, and not excellent.</p>

Resident rely heavily on these systems to guarantee their safety, and without the control board monitoring everything occurring within the home this is difficult.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.
