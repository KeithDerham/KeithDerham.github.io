Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm, especially due to the fact that incorrect alarms is a very real possibility.</p>

<p>The majority of monitoring companies will initially connect to you so that they can understand if the alarm was real or if it was a mishap. If you don't respond or you say that it wasn't a mishap, the alarm monitoring company will signal the authorities immediately.
