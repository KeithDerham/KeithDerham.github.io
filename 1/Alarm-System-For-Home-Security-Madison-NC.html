We have actually been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the free self-monitor" choice.</p>
