<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are developed to secure specific, concrete possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household heirlooms. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. If the item to which the gadget has been connected is moved or disrupted, the sensor will activate an alarm.</p>
