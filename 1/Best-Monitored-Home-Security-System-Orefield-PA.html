<p>Among the best elements of this alarm is that it has a very advanced motion sensor. It only gets triggered when a human is available in close distance due to the fact that it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to differentiate between people and other inanimate items or smaller living things. If your motion sensor is triggered, you get an alert in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get notified instantly so you can take instant actions such as setting off a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the prospective trespassers.</p>
<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>

On the other hand, if running wires isn't reasonable, you'll enjoy the flexibility that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras use. All these considerations will impact what system you ultimately pick. For instance, if you need to capture high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a consideration.</p>
