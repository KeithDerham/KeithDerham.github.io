<p>Any smart security system worth its salt provides parts that work together in a smooth environment and can be controlled using customized rules. For instance, you can create guidelines to have the lights turn on when motion is spotted, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera start tape-recording when a sensor is activated. Some systems store tape-recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage. In your area kept video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a spending plan, however you need to beware not to overwrite video you may require later.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
