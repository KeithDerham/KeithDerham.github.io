It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
