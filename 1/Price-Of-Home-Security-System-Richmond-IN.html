The more advanced cameras in the market permit two-way audio in between individuals on either side of the video surveillance system. When implemented correctly, two-way audio is a feature with lots of applications - security and non-security. This consists of background music services, delivering help-desk help from another location, improving loss prevention, monitoring high-traffic locations, hostility detection, and targeted retail messaging.</p>

<p>Perhaps. It depends upon which security company you choose. Numerous expertly monitored home security systems need a contract, and agreement length can vary from three to 5 years. However today you'll discover more home security choices than ever prior to that deal shorter contracts and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- specifically if you can pay for equipment up front. If you cancel early-- and some require 100%, the majority of home security companies will charge you around 75% of the staying term of your agreement.</p>
<p>Vivint's equipment is the most highly advanced of all the security companies on our list. Its wise home panel lets the system learn your routines, so it understands when to turn up the heat or dim the lights based on your regular and choices. And Vivint includes full access to its mobile app with every bundle-- a perk that the majority of companies make you spend for.</p>
<p>A smart lock is normally part of a robust clever home security setup, but you do not have to purchase a full-blown system to use one. You can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort if you're using a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats. Alternately, if you don't have a home automation center, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively simple to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

<p>Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that offer full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most affordable choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>

Try to find surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. Many designs also have a built-in IR cut-switch that automatically enables and disables the infrared technology depending on the lighting conditions.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We especially like this camera's wide, 180-degree field of vision, because you're less most likely to get a blind area anywhere you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
