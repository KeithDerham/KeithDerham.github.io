<p>Nevertheless, in any situation where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be bad since the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TELEVISION lines but the results are the exact same); they usually catch horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>

Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common grievances. Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and short of a basic power failure, are more difficult to interfere with. Despite a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer methods for hardwired systems to be interrupted and disarmed. </p>
