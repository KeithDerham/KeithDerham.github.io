<p>Hello there Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? You may access this camera via your smart device or PC and inspect out whether your camera is working if yes. If not, you might take a look at the dome camera during the night and see if there is any red glow emitted by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. The dome camera is working if yes. Hope this helps.</p>
