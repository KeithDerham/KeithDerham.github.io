In any case, a remote monitoring center must arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized individual in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be guaranteed that a further alarm action is unneeded. As with access codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, state, for heater repairperson to get in the kitchen area and basement sensor locations but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be gotten in and silence the local alarm, but still activate the remote alarm to summon the authorities to a break-in.</p>
