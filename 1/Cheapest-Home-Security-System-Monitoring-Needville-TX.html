<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Alexa support is included, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly handles all the typical functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
