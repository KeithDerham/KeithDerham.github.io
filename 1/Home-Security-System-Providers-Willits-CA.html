<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
