<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". If you're trying to find a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and smart IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>Cameras frequently broadcast video over the Internet, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely.

We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every wise camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
