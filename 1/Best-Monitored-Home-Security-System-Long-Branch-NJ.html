<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>

This camera provides a wide variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the roadway.

Nevertheless, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
