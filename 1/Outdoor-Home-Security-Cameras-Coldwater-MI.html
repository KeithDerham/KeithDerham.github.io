For beginners, it looks beautiful: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind.

This meant every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
