<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm System in Connecticut</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Video and image feeds have proved vital for surveillance - however there's room for more functionality by utilizing audio. Human beings have 5 senses that jointly permit us to properly range our environment. For that reason, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as lots of senses as possible is more efficient.
