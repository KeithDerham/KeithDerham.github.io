<p>During the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies hire taking a trip sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on homeowners. In many cases, the salesmen use misleading or high-pressure sales methods to get prospective consumers to buy pricey, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they do not require.</p>

These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients.
