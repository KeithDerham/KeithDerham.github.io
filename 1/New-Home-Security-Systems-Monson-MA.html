The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far goes beyond the minimal benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

Keep an eye on your home or business from every angle with the current security cameras.
