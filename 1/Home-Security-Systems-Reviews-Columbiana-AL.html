<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive aggressor, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the harmful enemy to tape these codes and use various cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
