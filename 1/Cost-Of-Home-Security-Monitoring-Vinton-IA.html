<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home intrusion emergency. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must be enough to scare away burglars in many cases. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to necessitate authorities action.</p>
