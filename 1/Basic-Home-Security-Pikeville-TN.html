<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
