That's practically $100 off the most pricey plan, The Sanctuary-- putting it at just under $400 total.

<p>The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensors and smart-home parts in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more versatile.

<p>However monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term plan, are becoming more common.
