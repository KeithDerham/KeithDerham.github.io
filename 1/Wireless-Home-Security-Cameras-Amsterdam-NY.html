Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
