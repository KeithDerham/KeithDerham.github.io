<p>Nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide attackers are clearly not discouraged by camera - and might even be attracted to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies offer discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use numerous "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
