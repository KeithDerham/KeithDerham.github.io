<p>The arguments for and against CCTV cameras below are purely examples of comments that have actually been discussed, and are not created to duplicate views from IFSEC Worldwide and its group. Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand name new Arlo Pro 3, which provides a comparable plan but with 2K video instead.

Displays can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home loaded with smart devices, consider looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- eventually a Thread-- radio that can connect them.

This enables the camera or monitor to respond to various scenarios, such as taking a picture when your Nest Protect identifies smoke, or telling your Philips Hue smart bulb to turn on when unexpected sounds are detected.</p>
