<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
