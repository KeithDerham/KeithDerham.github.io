<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera identifies motion or sound, you can trigger a video clip or a SmartThings automation.

<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.
