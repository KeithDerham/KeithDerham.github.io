<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, as soon as installed, is hard to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The team will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring if you've currently set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system.

Hardwired systems need very little maintenance, and short of a basic power failure, are harder to interfere with. Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and disabled. </p>
