In reality, we don't recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
