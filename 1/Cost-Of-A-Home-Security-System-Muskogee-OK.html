<h3>Security In The Home Muskogee OK 74403</h3>

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
