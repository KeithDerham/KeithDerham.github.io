<h3>Video Surveillance System in Fords NJ</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (usually positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to equip and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, wise alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). Nevertheless, wise alarms do require a center that allows the different parts to wirelessly connect. But for the majority of clever alarms this center can be positioned anywhere in your home.</p>

The one time where lag does end up being a bit of an issue is between taping and spotting motion. It takes a 2nd for the camera to really turn on when it finds motion because the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a dubious wrongdoer was fast enough.</p>
<p>As to how waterproof it is, time will inform. I hedged my bets and siliconed the body joint and where the wire enters into the back of the camera.
