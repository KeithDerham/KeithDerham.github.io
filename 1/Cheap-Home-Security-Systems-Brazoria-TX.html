But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
