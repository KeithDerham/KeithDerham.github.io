<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
