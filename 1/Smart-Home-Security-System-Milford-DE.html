Set a temporary password and reset it as quickly as you return if you go on vacation and have somebody coming over to inspect or feed family pets on your home.

<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't think that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
