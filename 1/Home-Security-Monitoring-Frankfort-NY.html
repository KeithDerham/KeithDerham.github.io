<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

When choosing a wired system, it's also crucial to consider how long you prepare to stay at the same home. Since these security systems are integrated into the home's electrical wiring, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
