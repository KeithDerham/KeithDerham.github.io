<h3>Monitored Home Security in Ohio</h3>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: ADT is right for you if you're looking for tried and real. If your location doesn't have reputable cell coverage, go with the basic landline package.

We specifically like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of view, because you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up.

You can get all the fundamentals like email, push, and SMS signals, in addition to 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's cheapest, Constantly On" strategy. However, you will need to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this does not included expert monitoring.
