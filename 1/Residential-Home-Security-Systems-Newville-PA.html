<p>To assess reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also require a license to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great option for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assailant, since the disruption of the network avoids the flow of information and in fact indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being transferred. The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the destructive attacker to record these codes and utilize numerous breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security crucial captured during the network healing.</p>
