<p>Home security should never be limited by where you can place or power your cameras, inside your home or outdoors. The Arlo Pro 2 Home Security System includes cameras that enable you to record your home from every angle, indoors and out, day and night.

Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured normally onerous and long contracts, and often rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed individually and don't suggest for most people.</p>
<h2>Security Cameras & CCTV Gray</h2>
