<p>A subsidiary of Amazon, Ring's Alarm security package fasts to install and simple to use.

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further circuitry.

Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
