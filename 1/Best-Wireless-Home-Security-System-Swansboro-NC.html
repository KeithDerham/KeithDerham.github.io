Reliability has long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems.

<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
