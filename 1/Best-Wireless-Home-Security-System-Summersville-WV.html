If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
