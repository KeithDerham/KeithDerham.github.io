<p>The Kasa Cam Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. Nevertheless, there are a couple of tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Cam has to be plugged in to an outlet to receive power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection in between its cable and power supply is not.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that it can be hard to discover power sources for outside cameras, we like that the Ring Spotlight Cam has 3 power options: battery, hardwired, or solar.

<p>Expenses for systems vary. Larger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives.
