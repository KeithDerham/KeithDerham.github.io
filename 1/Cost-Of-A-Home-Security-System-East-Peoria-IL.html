<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
