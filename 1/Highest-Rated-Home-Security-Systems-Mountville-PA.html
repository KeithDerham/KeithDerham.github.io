It will tape clips when it views movement (and a few seconds before so you get the full view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week prior to they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, but I don't believe many people will need that option.</p>

<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off?
