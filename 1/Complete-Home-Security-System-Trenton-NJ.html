<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
