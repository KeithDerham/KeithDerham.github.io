<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will like. However for everyone who enjoys ADT, it looks like there's someone who's had a dreadful experience. Part of that is because ADT has more clients than most brand names-- which indicates it has more possibilities to run into problems. But part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
