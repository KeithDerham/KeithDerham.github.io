<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.

Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
