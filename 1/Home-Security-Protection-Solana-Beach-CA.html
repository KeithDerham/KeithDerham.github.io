<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
