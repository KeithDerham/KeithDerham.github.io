<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least three years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
<p>The most significant, baddest function is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you extremely crisp, clear footage that lets you focus on details like faces and license plates without messing up your image quality.

Lennar, as it happens, is directly connected now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not special to Lennar homeowners. </p>
