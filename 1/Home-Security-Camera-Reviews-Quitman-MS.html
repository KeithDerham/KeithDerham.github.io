<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and an individual, for example, enables you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
