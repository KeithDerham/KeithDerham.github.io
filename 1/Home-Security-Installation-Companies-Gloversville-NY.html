<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the service technician supplied strong customer care: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some issues with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
