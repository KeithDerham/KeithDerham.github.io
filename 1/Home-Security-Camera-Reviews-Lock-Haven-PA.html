<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the same individual could position a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at an affordable cost, the one location where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
