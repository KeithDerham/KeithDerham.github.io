<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad.

And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
