We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.
