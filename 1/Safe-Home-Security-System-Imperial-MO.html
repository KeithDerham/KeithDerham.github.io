<p>When it pertains to professional monitoring, Brinks has lots of experience. Besides monitoring its own packages, Brinks also contracts with other security companies to offer monitoring.

To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and provide physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to call for police reaction.</p>
