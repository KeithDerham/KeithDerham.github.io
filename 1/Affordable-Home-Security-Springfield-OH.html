Modern systems now have phenomenal capabilities", though these have produced easy to understand misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and possible abuse such capabilities create.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year contract, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
