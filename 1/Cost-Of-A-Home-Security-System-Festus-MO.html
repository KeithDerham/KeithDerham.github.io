<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Dependability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending upon which functions and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connection are still common grievances. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and except a basic power blackout, are more difficult to disrupt. Despite a basic improvement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and crippled. </p>
