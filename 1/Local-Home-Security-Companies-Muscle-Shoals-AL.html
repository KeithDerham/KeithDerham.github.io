<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gotten quite the excitement over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring charges.
