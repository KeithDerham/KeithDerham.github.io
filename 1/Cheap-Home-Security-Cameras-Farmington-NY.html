<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
