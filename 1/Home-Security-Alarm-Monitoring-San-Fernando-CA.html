The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive assailant to record these codes and use numerous splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security essential caught throughout the network healing.</p>
