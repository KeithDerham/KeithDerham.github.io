<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
