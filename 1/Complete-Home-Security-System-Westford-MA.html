<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial homes tend to have even higher incorrect alarm rates than residential properties since more people tend to share duty for triggering and shutting down the alarm, and the systems tend to be more complicated.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
