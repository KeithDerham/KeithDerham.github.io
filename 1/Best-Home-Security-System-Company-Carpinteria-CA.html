<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
