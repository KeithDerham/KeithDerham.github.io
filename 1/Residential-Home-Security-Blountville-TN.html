<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the restricted series of sensors. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This implies that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet. When aiming to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of factors to think about.</p>
