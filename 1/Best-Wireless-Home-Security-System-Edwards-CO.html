<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive assaulter, since the disruption of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the harmful enemy to record these codes and use different splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>
