<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate instead of purchasing a self-monitored security system.

The one time where lag does become a little a problem is between tape-recording and finding motion. It takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it discovers motion since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording. They might get past the camera prior to it had time to record them if a nefarious crook was quick enough.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Nevertheless, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer. </p>
