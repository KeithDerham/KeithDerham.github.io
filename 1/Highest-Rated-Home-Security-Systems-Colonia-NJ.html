<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems usually do not come with upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements!
