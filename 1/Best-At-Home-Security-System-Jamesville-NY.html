<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
