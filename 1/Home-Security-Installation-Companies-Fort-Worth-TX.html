<p>Think of it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be cost the low rate of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To provide such low prices, producers must cut corners, and the end result is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like intense sunshine?

<p>In spite of the fact that almost all major home security companies feature amazing styles, SimpliSafe equipment is distinct and rather elegant in its look.
