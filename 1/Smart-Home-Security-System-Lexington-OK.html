Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
<h2>Automated Video Surveillance And Alarm System Lexington</h2>

Systems like Nest Secure, Residence, and Ring Alarm will all let you self-monitor your system totally free. But Scout makes you pay a $10 regular monthly subscription fee. Wamp wamp.
