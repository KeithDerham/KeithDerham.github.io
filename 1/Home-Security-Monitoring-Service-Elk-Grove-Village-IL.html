<p>Hello Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? You may access this camera via your smart device or PC and inspect out whether your camera is working if yes. If not, you may have a look at the dome camera in the evening and see if there is any red glow emitted by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. If yes, then the dome camera is working. Hope this helps.</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural merging of security innovations.

A picture of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>
