<p>Hello Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? You may access this camera via your smart device or PC and inspect out whether your camera is working if yes.

Hope this helps.</p>

A picture of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>
