<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security group and, in some cases, emergency responders. Sadly, history has actually shown that surveillance technologies put in location for one purpose inevitably broaden into other uses. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems need to be able to do positions a considerable risk.</p>
