Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand name new Arlo Pro 3, which provides a comparable package but with 2K video rather. It's a wonderful all-round system (particularly with multiple cameras) and must certainly be weighed up along with the Ultra when looking for a new security camera system.</p>

Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Camera has to be plugged in to an outlet to receive power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection between its cable and power supply is not.</p>
<p>Do not be deceived by the Nest Secure system's good appearances. It's a pricey system that gets costlier with everything you incorporate. Expect to pay an additional Nest Aware cost for every camera you install, including the Nest Hey there doorbell. Monitoring is provided by Brinks Home Security however does not include fire service with the Nest Protect. And although we appreciate geofencing, we had several mistakes with that feature during testing.</p>

There are just three packages to choose from, and its equipment offerings are focused on home security basics like entry sensors, motion detectors, and smoke and carbon monoxide gas monitoring.
