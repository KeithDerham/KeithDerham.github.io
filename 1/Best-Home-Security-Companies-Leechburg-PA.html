<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
