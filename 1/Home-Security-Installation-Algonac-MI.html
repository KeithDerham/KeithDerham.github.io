<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is important.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to distinguish between a cars and truck and an individual, for instance, permits you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
