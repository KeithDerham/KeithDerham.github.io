<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life.

<p>Last, we also think about how much it costs to see, save and share tape-recorded video.

If the system was not installed during the homebuilding process, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and accessing to tough areas that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise susceptible to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an interruption, however long term outages will lead to the system losing power.
