<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce crime. The overall cost of a home security system can be measured in 3 stages: purchase cost, installation costs, and operating costs over time. Purchase price differs by provider, equipment package, and payment alternatives.

<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and normally onerous agreements, and often count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and don't suggest for most people.</p>
