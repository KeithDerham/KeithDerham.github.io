<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system finds a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security group and, sometimes, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has actually shown that surveillance innovations put in place for one purpose undoubtedly broaden into other uses.
