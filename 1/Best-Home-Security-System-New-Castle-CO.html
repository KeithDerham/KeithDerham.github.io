Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>Our ADT Seattle group uses expert home security installation and a variety of security and automation products and options.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration).
