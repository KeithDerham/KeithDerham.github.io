<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually found trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens might break local noise control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a little more if you wish to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to rent their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum contract requirement.</p>
