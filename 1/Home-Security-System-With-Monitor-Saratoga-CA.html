<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
