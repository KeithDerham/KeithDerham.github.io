Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading scientists to ask about forthcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was international in scope.</p>
