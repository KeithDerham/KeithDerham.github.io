<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, beginning with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely wide location, and you can dim them through its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a party. Video surveillance systems are more crucial than ever in today's business environment.

<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller sized than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most excellent response time of all home security companies we evaluated. Their timeframe for reaction in under 10 seconds, which we must admit is quite impressive. A note of importance, if you want to get the SimpliSafe app, then you would need to register for the more expensive monitoring plan.</p>
<p>While a lot of service providers offer you the alternative to add both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security package, SimpliSafe's selection is limited to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera consists of functions like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, however it doesn't take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic features discovered on most surveillance cameras. </p>
