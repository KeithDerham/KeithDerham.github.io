<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
