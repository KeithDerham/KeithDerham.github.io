<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run inside your home or inside your home - you get a lot of flexibility from this little device. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is easy to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the reassurance of professional monitoring.</p>

This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take. </p>
