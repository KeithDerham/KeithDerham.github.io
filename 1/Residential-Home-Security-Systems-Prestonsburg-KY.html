<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
