<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
