<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
