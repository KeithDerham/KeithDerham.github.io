<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable cost, the one area where the company especially stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
