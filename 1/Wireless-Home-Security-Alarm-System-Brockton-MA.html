When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
