When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

We initially observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite.
