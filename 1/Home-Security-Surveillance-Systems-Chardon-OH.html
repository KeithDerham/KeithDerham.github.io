<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
