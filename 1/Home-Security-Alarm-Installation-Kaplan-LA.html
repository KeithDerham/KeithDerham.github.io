Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare a person and a car, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
