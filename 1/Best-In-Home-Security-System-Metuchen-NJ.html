<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since many retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some extra money while giving a customer change, for example), we think it's more vital to have top quality images so you have the evidence you require. Which's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, try to select a camera with a relatively broad field of view (viewing angle) and make sure it can capture clear night vision video. Most cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to provide black-and-white night video, however there are a few out there that usage white light to deliver full-color night video. Look for a camera with a night vision series of at least 30 feet.</p>

<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you may want to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, sometimes suited everyday objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

Otherwise, this company offers a similar feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is readily available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not better, than the wired systems.
