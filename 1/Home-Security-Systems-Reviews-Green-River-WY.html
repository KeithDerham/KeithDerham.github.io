Expert installation with expert monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT professionally install and monitor your system-- you do not have to raise a finger or babysit signals. Over my 25 plus year career in the security industry, I have actually looked into, offered, installed, and due to the fact that we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I want to confess.</p>
