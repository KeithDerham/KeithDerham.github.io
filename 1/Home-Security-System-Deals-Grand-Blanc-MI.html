<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's design - undoubtedly the most visually pleasing camera on this list.

We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs).

<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you might wish to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are discreet and small, sometimes fitted into daily objects such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets. If you need to document an important conference in a public place, an individual hidden camera built into a watch or pen might be a good option.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
