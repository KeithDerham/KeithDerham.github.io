<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
