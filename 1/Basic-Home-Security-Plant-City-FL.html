<p>This normally would go in a closet or energy room somewhere in the facilities. It is utilized in older or bigger systems to link the components. Generally you would find a PCB with lots of terminals or antennas for connections. Many likewise have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some might have a serial port for connection to a specialist's computer for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system. The majority of control (interface) panels link straight to this panel in older or bigger wired systems.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the client service experience differs widely depending on the dealership you opt for. </p>
