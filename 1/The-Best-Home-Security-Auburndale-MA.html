We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
