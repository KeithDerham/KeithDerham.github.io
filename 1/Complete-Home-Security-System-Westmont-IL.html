<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly attempted to give it an attractive edge, and we need to provide credit to its capability to show what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable television attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to undermine for prospective burglars.
