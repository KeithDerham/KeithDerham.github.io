The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later.

<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has identified trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
