<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and belongings. In the event that your alarm is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to react by instantaneously contacting you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>

<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies?
