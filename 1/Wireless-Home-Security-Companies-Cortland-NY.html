<p>Thanks to current advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you should think about the following benefits of wireless innovation. By integrating LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the market. During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to set up and utilize-- but not rather as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.
